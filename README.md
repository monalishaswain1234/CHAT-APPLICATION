 What We Did:
Built a live messaging platform where users can send and receive messages instantly without reloading the page. The frontend interacts with a backend server through WebSockets, ensuring real-time bi-directional data flow using Socket.IO.

 Tools Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Real-Time Layer: Socket.IO (WebSocket library)

Storage: Messages are not stored (temporary communication only)

 Why This is Applicable:
Live messaging is one of the most in-demand web features — from customer support systems to gaming chats and collaborative tools. This project replicates the backend logic behind chat apps like WhatsApp or Discord. It teaches how to manage user events (connect, disconnect, message send), room broadcasting, and real-time DOM updates — all vital for developers in modern applications.  **
